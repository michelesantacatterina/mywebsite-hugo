      <description>COVID-19 is the most significant global health emergency in recent memory, with hundreds of thousands dead and widespread economic disruption.
The goal of this project is to understand the distribution, treatments and effects of COVID-19, particularly on underserved populations, ultimately improving public health. I am a co-investigator of two COVID-19 projects with the following aims:
 To develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning techniques to better prevent and optimally treat the deadly disease.</description>

      <title>Novel statistical methods for the optimal use of real-world patient data to improve clinical decision-making</title>

      <description>Evidence-based medicine requires investigators to include the best available evidence into their clinical decision-making process. The best evidence regarding the causal effect of a treatment can be provided by properly conducted randomized trials. However, randomized trials, can be costly, infeasible, or unethical.
The goal of this project is to developed novel biostatistical methods that optimally leverage trialsâ€™ results and data from electronic medical registries which is more representative of real-world clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Optimal care for patients undergoing surgical interventions</title>

      <description>Back pain is one of the most common causes of work loss due to disability, posing an economic burden on society in the United States. Understanding what are the patient features that are highly predictive for patient-reported outcomes, is essential to help to provide the best cares for patients and more cost-effective interventions.
The goal of this project is to provide best practices for treatment care and management of patients who underwent surgical interventions.</description>

      <title>Understanding and predicting the risk of bleeding disorders</title>

      <description>Bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease and hemophilia are conditions that occur when the blood cannot clot properly.
Because the clinical burden, societal impact and economic impact of mild and severe bleeding disorders are not as clearly understood, I will
 apply novel biostatistical and machine learning methods to help understand and predict the risk of bleeding disorders,
 apply novel causal inference methods to evaluate the effect of clinical interventions on the risk of bleeding disorders, and</description>

      <title>HIV: epidemiology, optimal treatments and interventions in the international setting</title>

      <description>HIV is a global pandemic with more than 37 million people living with HIV worldwide. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially improved the prognosis and treatment of patients living with HIV/AIDS. However, its use and implementation have some challenges.
The goal of this project is to investigate best practices and implementations of ART.
Because the HIV virus has a great variety of subtypes which can lead to sub-optimal treatment care. I investigated the trends of HIV subtypes in Sweden, and, by using the Swedish InfCare HIV database and a multinomial regression model, I found that HIV-subtypes in Sweden are very diverse.</description>

      <title>Optimal public health policies in vulnerable populations worldwide</title>
      <link>https://michelesantacatterina.github.io/old-projects/vulnerable_pop/</link>

      <description>Clinicians and policy makers face enormous challenges in the treatment and prevention of people from vulnerable populations, such as people from resources-limited areas, rural areas, or those that use injection drugs.
The goal of this project was to investigate factors related to specific behaviors and evaluate the impact of public health policies to reduce risk behaviors in vulnerable populations.
To better improve prevention of infectious diseases spread (such as HIV and Hepatitis C) among people who inject drugs, I designed and analyzed a retrospective observational study using Swedish data over a 10-year period and a logistic regression model to evaluate the most important factors related to risk behaviors, such as having shared injection drug solution; and having lent out or having received already used drug injection equipment.</description>
