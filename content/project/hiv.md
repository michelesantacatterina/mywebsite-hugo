HIV is a global pandemic with more than 37 million people living with HIV worldwide. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially improved the prognosis and treatment of patients living with HIV/AIDS. However, its use and implementation have some challenges. 

The goal of this project is to investigate best practices and implementations of ART.

Because the HIV virus has a great variety of subtypes which can lead to sub-optimal treatment care. I investigated the trends of HIV subtypes in Sweden, and, by using the Swedish InfCare HIV database and a multinomial regression model, I found that HIV-subtypes in Sweden are very diverse. These findings can help understanding how HIV diversity affects HIV prevention, antiretroviral treatment, and vaccine development.

Because of the difficulty in resources-limited settings to sustain ART programs to prevent drug resistance and treatment failure, I investigated if peer support has an impact on virologic and immunologic treatment outcomes among HIV infected patients. To do so, I designed a randomized clinical trial and investigated if peer support has an effect on time to viral failure and death by using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. In addition, I investigated if peer support has an effect on CD4 cell count trends over time by using mixed-effect models. From the results of these investigations, I found that peer support has no impact on virologic failure and CD4 trends as well as on mortality after 24 months of ART initiation.

To better understand the effect of treatment switch from first-line to second-line HIV treatment, I used the Swedish InfCare HIV database and a Laplace regression model to analyze the impact of patients’ reasons for treatment switch on the median, 10th, 20th, 30th and 40th percentile of time to viral failure after second-line switch. I found that there was no significant difference in time to second-line treatment failure between reasons for treatment switch. However, I found that the level of viral load at first-line ART failure had a significant impact on failure of second-line HIV treatment starting after 2.5 years of second-line treatment.
