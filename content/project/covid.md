COVID-19 is the most significant global health emergency in recent memory, with hundreds of thousands dead and widespread economic disruption. 

The goal of this project is to understand the distribution, treatments and effects of COVID-19, particularly on underserved populations, ultimately improving public health. I am a co-investigator of two COVID-19 projects with the following aims:

- To develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning techniques to better prevent and optimally treat the deadly disease. More info on the studies can be found [here](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/projects/covid-19crp) and [here](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/content/george-washington-university-biostatistics-center-launches-three-covid-19-projects). 

- To develop deep convolutional neural network survival methods to fully exploit medical images and time-dependent features to predict the probability of experiencing death, ICU admission, ICU discharge and hospital discharge. In collaboration with Weill Cornell and Columbia University.
