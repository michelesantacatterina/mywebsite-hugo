abstract = "Marginal structural models (MSM) have been used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on an outcome of interest with longitudinal data in observational studies. Despite their theoretical appeal, these methods are highly sensitive to misspecifications of the treatment assignment model and can lead high-variance estimates due to extreme weights whenever true propensities may be close to 0 or 1. In this paper, we present Kernel Optimal Weighting (KOW) which provides weights that optimally balance time-invariant and time-dependent confounders while controlling for the precision of the resulting MSM estimate. The method minimizes the error in estimation due to time-dependent confounding, expressed as an imbalance operator derived from a new decomposition of the weighted mean estimator, using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and quadratic programming. We evaluate the performance of KOW in a simulation study, comparing it with inverse probability weighting, stable inverse probability weighting, and the recently proposed covariate balancing propensity scores. We further extended KOW to control for informative censoring. We apply KOW to study the effect of treatment initiation on time to death among people who live with HIV and to study the effect of negative advertising on vote shares in the United States."
