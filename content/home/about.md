# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the [Division of Biostatistics](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/) at the [Department of Population Health](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/), [NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/). I am also a Research Advisor at Google DeepMind, working with [Ramin Zabih](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdz/). I served as a Visiting Researcher at Google from 2022 to 2025. 

Previously, I was an Assistant Research Professor of Biostatistics at the [Biostatistics Center](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/) and the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-bioinformatics) at the [George Washington University School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/), and a postdoctoral associate at the [Cornell TRIPODS Center for Data Science](https://tripods.cis.cornell.edu/) and [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) mentored by Dr. [Nathan Kallus](http://www.nathankallus.com/) and Prof. [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/). 

My research focuses on the development and applications of causal, statistical, AI and data science methods for optimal decision making using real-world and experimental data.
