# Biography

I am an Assistant Research Professor in the [Biostatistics Center](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/) and the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-bioinformatics) at the [George Washington University School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/). My research focuses on the development and applications of statistical and data science methods for optimal decision making using real-world and experimental data. Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at the [Cornell TRIPODS Center for Data Science](https://tripods.cis.cornell.edu/) and [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/).
