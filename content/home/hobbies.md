When I am not reading about biostatistics and data science, I like to learn more about contemporary history. I also enjoy keeping myself active by running. I love to play and listen to music, especially electronic and film music. Over the past few years, I have started several electronic music projects that involve production using [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/). Last but not least, I love to play, cuddle and spoil my fluffy dog [*Mister Pom Princess ``PK'' Cake*](https://www.instagram.com/pk_the_pom/).
