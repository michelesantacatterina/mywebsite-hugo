When I’m not immersed in biostatistics, I enjoy reading contemporary history and science fiction. I’m a Liverpool FC supporter. To stay active, I run regularly. Music is another passion of mine, I love both listening and creating, especially electronic and film music. Over the past few years, I’ve launched several electronic music projects using [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).

And last but not least, I spend as much time as possible playing with, cuddling, and spoiling my fluffy dog, [*Mister Pom Princess ``PK'' Cake*](https://www.instagram.com/pk_the_pom/).
